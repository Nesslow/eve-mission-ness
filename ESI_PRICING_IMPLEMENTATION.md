# ESI Pricing Implementation

## Overview
This implementation replaces the simple Fuzzwork aggregate API with a more robust ESI-based pricing system that provides accurate, real-time market valuation based on active Jita 4-4 station orders.

## Changes Made

### Constants Added
- `ESI_BASE_URL`: 'https://esi.evetech.net/latest'
- `THE_FORGE_REGION_ID`: 10000002
- `JITA_4_4_STATION_ID`: 60003760

### Modified Functions

#### `getPrices(typeIds)`
**Before:** Simple aggregated pricing from Fuzzwork API
**After:** ESI-based pricing with the following algorithm:
1. Fetch all sell orders from The Forge region for each type ID
2. Filter orders to include only those at Jita 4-4 station
3. Sort filtered orders by price (ascending)
4. Calculate volume of the lowest 5% of orders
5. Return weighted average price of those orders

**Features:**
- Individual API calls for each type ID for accuracy
- Proper error handling per type ID
- Detailed logging for debugging
- Fallback to Fuzzwork API when ESI is unavailable

#### `calculateShipValue(items)`
**Enhanced with:**
- Better logging for debugging
- Improved error handling
- Clear progress reporting
- Graceful degradation when APIs are unavailable

#### `isApiAvailable()`
**Updated to:**
- Check ESI status endpoint first
- Fall back to Fuzzwork API check
- Return proper availability status

### New Functions

#### `getFuzzworkPrices(typeIds)`
- Fallback function for when ESI is unavailable
- Maintains backward compatibility
- Uses original Fuzzwork aggregated pricing

## Error Handling
- Network failures are handled gracefully
- Individual item failures don't break the entire calculation
- Detailed logging helps with debugging
- Fallback mechanisms ensure robustness

## Testing
The implementation includes comprehensive error handling and logging. Due to network restrictions in test environments, the system gracefully falls back to returning 0 when APIs are unavailable.

## Usage
The pricing system is automatically used when adding ships in the main application. Users will see more accurate pricing based on real-time Jita 4-4 market data when the APIs are available.

## API Dependencies
1. **Primary:** ESI (Eve Swagger Interface) - for real-time market data
2. **Secondary:** Fuzzwork API - for type ID lookup and fallback pricing
3. **Tertiary:** Graceful degradation when no APIs are available
